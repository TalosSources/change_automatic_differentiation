reproducing empirical models

Building the pipeline, struggling with data loading
# 2
Analyisis of the problem: how important is rs to the value of Q_LE? what parts do we control, which are well/poorly estimated? what's the scope of the project, what are the hopes of the project? (scopes&hopes). other stuff like that
# 2
training with real data
# 3 
full pipeline?
# 4
training with different predictors (to improve results?)
# 4.5 (if time)
Try Julia

Different training schemes explored: from one/multiple sites, using chronological/singleRandom/batchRandom, aggregating daily/multi-hourly/anotherTimeFrame?, hyperparameters?. Ablation study with all those stuff. Try to make a streamlined codebase to simplify testing all these different choices. Take inspiration from RL-Project, with configs, wandb, etc.
