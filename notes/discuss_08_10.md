# Modelling the empirical GSCO2
* took me time to get the training pipeline right, first I couldn't fit simple test functions
* show the slice plots
* it works but I had to build quite a large model
* possible reasons: the data I simulate is senseless and creates an overly complex function

# Found dataset for stomatal behaviour
* show the csv, I still need to interpret its fields

# Read through papers
* hourly: not entirely clear, say what I understood, ask whether it's correct.
* ask about random forests, is it something he used
* hybrid evapotranspiration: say it seems quite clear, I could implement something like that, see potential for hybrid modelling

# Code translation
* present the CO2_Concentration.m and Canopy_Resistence_An_Evolution.m situation, say I also translated CO2.. but it makes little sense.

# misc
* started to read about bayesian learning?
